# Day 2 solution in Scratch

Since the problem was trivial today, I decided to tackle one of the hardest languages I want to use for this year's Advent of Code: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

If you aren't aware, Scratch is a programming language for children that lets you visually combine a variety of building blocks to create small interactive games or animations.

Here's a screenshot of the solution in Scratch's editor:

Unfortunately, the small text input box that Scratch provides does not support newlines so I had to replace all of the newlines in the input with spaces.

Fortunately, the input box does not seem to have any restrictions on the number of characters that can be entered, so I was able to entire 1000 lines of input in the input box without any problems.
