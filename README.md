# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges so far.

The goal for this year is to solve the challenges using a different language every day. Hopefully, I won't have to resort to writing x86 assembly...

## Languages used so far

- **Day 1**: [OCaml](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_01)
- **Day 2**: [C](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_02) and [Scratch](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_02_scratch)
- **Day 3**: [Java](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_03) - I tried to use Forth, but I didn't have the time to get familiar enough with the language to use it to write a solution for the challenge on the same day.
- **Day 4**: [Haskell](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_04) - I had a lot of fun completing this day! Haskell is a really nice language to work with :)
- **Day 5**: [Lua](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_05)
- **Day 6**: [(Typed) Racket](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_06)
- **Day 7**: [APL](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day_07)
